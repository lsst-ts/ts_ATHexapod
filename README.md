```
### EUI
Run the EUI executing using the instructions above. 
The GUI needs to be running before you execute the controller as the GUI gets information from summary state and updates the view according to it and cannot information prior to execution.  

Where 3 tabs are shown:
* Overview: 
  * Summary of the device. Currently only has all the events. The dropdown list has the list of recommended settings (needs to be Default1 to start)
![alt text][overview]

* Controls 
  * All the commands that can be executed (to see the commands, the application needs to be in EnabledState). The list of commands are:
    * applyPositionLimits: Set the limit for the positions (Also set in the configuration file)
    * moveToPosition: Move to a position for X, Y, Z, U, V and W.
    * setMaxSpeeds: Not implemented yet.
    * stopAllAxes: Stop all motion, it will only be accepted if the Hexapod is in motion. Its value in the GUI is a placeholder for organization purpose and is not settable 
    * pivot: Set the pivot in the PI Hexapod controller. Position needs to be 0 for U, V and W (Also set in the configuration file)
    * applyPositionOffset: Move an additional offset from current position.

### Configuration
Configuration files
Inside the software folder there is a folder called settingFiles, inside this folder are:
* mainSetup.yaml : configuration file that is executed at run time. It has recommended settings and aliases (for recommended settings) 
* Folders inside settingFiles are versions of different settings, these are executed at the start of the application and used the start settingsToApply attribute to select which setting version to use. Currently there are 2 configuration files:
  ** initialHexapodSetup.yaml: Initial configuration of the hexapod
  ** tcpConfiguration.yaml: TCP Configuration for the ATHexapod controller
